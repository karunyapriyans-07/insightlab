Project Idea: "InsightLab"
What it is: A Multimodal Scientific Analyzer. The user uploads a picture of a scientific chart, graph, or lab result. Gemini 3 analyzes the image, identifies the data trends, and uses Function Calling to look up relevant scientific principles or definitions from a database to explain why the data looks that way.
Text Description (~200 words)
InsightLab is a multimodal application designed to accelerate scientific data interpretation. Built using the Gemini 3 Pro API, the application accepts images of raw lab charts or experimental graphs.

We leveraged Gemini 3’s state-of-the-art multimodal understanding to accurately interpret visual data trends—identifying key markers like exponential growth or unexpected plateaus without requiring manual data entry. Central to the application is Gemini 3's improved Function Calling capability. Once the visual trend is identified, Gemini automatically queries a structured scientific database to retrieve contextual explanations for the observed phenomena.

Finally, we utilized Gemini’s advanced reasoning to synthesize the visual analysis and database lookup into a cohesive, expert-level report for the user. This reduces the time researchers spend referencing basic principles, allowing them to focus on high-level analysis.
